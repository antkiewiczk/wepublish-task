# Coding problem - drawing program

This is a recruitment task for We.Publish.

The goal of this task is to create a console drawing program that will allow user to create a board with x and y
dimensions and later allow the user to "draw" a shape on the same board. Supported shapes: rectangle and line.
The user can also "fill" the space similarily as the bucket fill tool in ms paint.

This project is written in javascript with typescript, utilizing node.js.

The project was bootstrapped from [this boilerplate](https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-typescript-boilerplate)
to speed up setting up the environment as well as typescript, eslint, jest and prettier support.

To run the application, clone the repo, go to the folder and type

```
yarn
```
or
```
npm install
```
After installing the packages, you need to build the project using either
```
yarn build
```
or
```
yarn build:watch
```
When the project is built, simply run
```
yarn start
```
To play with the functionality!

## Supported commands

```
C w h           Create a new canvas of width w and height h.
L x1 y1 x2 y2   Create a new line of 'x' from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Only support 
                horizontal or vertical lines.
R x1 y1 x2 y2   Create a new rectangle, (x1,y1) is upper left corner & (x2,y2) is 
                lower right corner.
B x y c         Fill the entire area around (x,y) with "colour" c.
                Same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint programs.
Q               Quit.
```

User input is prefixed with `Enter command: `
